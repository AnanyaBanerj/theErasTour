        <h2> Dear Taylor,  </h2>
        <h3>  </h3>

        <p>
How are you? How are Olivia, Benjamin and Meredith?  I hope you are resting properly after those 6 grand shows in Singapore. Lots of love and hugs to Travis, and I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE TORTURED POETS DEPRTMENT, OMG WHAT WAS THAT ANNOUNCEMENT??????!!!!!!!!! (PS: Congratulations on the Grammys, I knew you were going to win it, like duh!!). 
I'm writing to you today with a heart overflowing with gratitude and emotions that words struggle to encapsulate. Reflecting on the past year, I find myself in awe of the profound impact you've had on my life, an impact that has woven itself into the very fabric of my existence. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
IT’S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING…. held in the minds of the millions of SWIFTIES around the world when you announced on CBN, “I am going on tour again, it’s going to contain 17 years of music throughout my career, see you there”. Everyone just lost their minds, ENCHANTED to some other world, as no one knew what was coming for them on THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Having started June 2, 2023, FAST FORWARD TO A HUNDRED AMAZING SOLD OUT SHOWS LATER, The Eras tour has become the biggest concert in the history of concerts. And why wouldn’t it be? Because how smart is it of you to tour the world with not just your latest album but your entire, famously loved discography spanning 17 years of earth shattering and record-breaking songs that live in the WILDEST DREAMS of the entire world. It was your sixth concert tour, with 152 shows planned over 5 continents. 152 showss? Do you ever sleep?
<br>
<br><br>
The Eras tour (obviously the movie in PVR because you wouldn’t come to India) was everything I had ever imagined it to be. The colours, the costumes, the dancers, the music and the 44 songs that have literally shaped people’s personalities. How can a person sing and dance with so much energy for so long??? Please put a story on Taylor nation about your daily diet please. My favourite part of the tour was obviously the folklore Era. My tears Ricochet was the most raw and honest performance ever.
<br><br><br>  
But the red Era was out of this world. The way you give the 22 hats to a special person at every show, like how many times do you want to win the same hearts again?  Watching the tour film made me feel like the song Everything has changed and the lyrics “And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies; beautiful kind, making up for lost time, taking’ flight” never felt more relatable.
<br><br><br>


“But statistics, numbers and money aside, what does Taylor Swift mean to a person? Apart from being a cultural phenomenon that rocked the world, that boosted economies, that created millions of employments and made Taylor swift a billionaire, why is Taylor Swift as popular and as big as she is?”, my mom asked me this yesterday, when I was obsessing over your music and forcing her to watch the Disney Hotstar concert film with the new songs. Well, I told her a lot of things, and I tried to put into words to tell her what you mean to me. And that very night, I came up with a poem. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    I know, writing a poem for you is like sending audition tapes to Meryl Streep, but here it goes, a little try to the connoisseur of poetry:</p>

        <h2>Lover</h2>
        <p>After the unfortunate cancellation of her "Lover Fest" tour due to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, Taylor Swift made a heartfelt choice to start the show with "Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince," a beloved track from her album "Lover." Embracing the joyful and vibrant theme of the album, she wore a specially crafted pastel Versace bodysuit, adorned with playful colors, sequins, and fringe. This personalized touch beautifully captured the essence and spirit of "Lover" in a way that resonated deeply with fans.</p>

      <div class="about-text">
        <h2>Fearless</h2>
        <p>Swift came out for the next era in a golden fringe, flapper-like dress while performing the title track "Fearless." Custom made by Roberto Cavalli, the champagne colored dress is a staple in the "Fearless" era.
            <br>
            Teenage romanticism is a consistent theme throughout this era, and Swift shows that youthful freedom in the way she moves her body during classics like "You Belong With Me" and "Love Story."
            On the second night of the tour, she swapped out the short fringe for a longer version of the dress, also handcrafted by Cavalli. As she jumps around on stage and shakes the fringe, she reminisces on her past, proving that she is fearless. She even recreates some of the same moves from her "Fearless Tour." The inspiration behind the golden dresses on "The Eras Tour" comes from her original dress worn on her debut tour, also paired with her classic red lip and winged eyeliner.

      <div class="about-text">
        <h2>Evermore</h2>
        <p>TikTok Swifties are quick to assume that the "evermore" era is Swift’s least favorite album, but she proved them wrong when she mentioned this on the opening night of the tour. As she sat down at her green, moss covered piano, she wore a deep mustard colored floor length dress with a lace-up corset top custom made by Etro. While at the piano, she discussed her writing process during quarantine for this album, the sister album to her previous one, "folklore." The sister albums were unlike anything Swifties had heard from her, so the aesthetic was something new. Unlike her past performances in bright pastel colors or long fringe, "evermore" can be described as a cottage core aesthetic. From "’tis the damn season" to "champagne problems," Swift had the crowd screaming the lyrics while she put the same emotion into it on stage.    Cozy sweaters, plaid, braided hair and long dresses are all ways to represent "evermore." To match the simple vibe of her indie era, there was no need for Swift to make a large, flashy production out of this set. She knew the words would speak for themselves.

        <h2>Reputation</h2>
        <p>Swift’s "reputation" era was a time of owning up to the negative reputation she's earned from the press. Swift showed she wasn't afraid of the media through dark colors, edgy patterns and snake print.Before this album, she was seen as a typical American sweetheart, but after Kanye West publicly humiliated Swift by taking her award on stage and Scooter Braun stole the rights to her music, Swift wanted to prove she could stand up for herself and was unafraid. Her edgy persona officially began after leaving the public eye for months. In her song "Look What You Made Me Do," Swift claims the old Taylor can't answer the phone “cause she’s dead.” On opening night, she brought back the snake theme from her 2018 "Reputation Tour" by wearing a black and red high-leg, asymmetrical jumpsuit covered in a snake that wrapped around her leg. The snake represents all the fake people who've betrayed her throughout her career. Also made by Robert Cavalli, the jumpsuit embodied her drastic change from being a "good girl" to making one of the biggest comebacks in the music industry. This dark energy delivered on stage brought many fans back to the fierce energy seen in Swift's 2018 stadium tour.

      <div class="about-text">
        <h2>Speak Now</h2>
        <p>Once the first show ended, the "Speak Now" portion of the night left Swifties confused.
            "Enchanted" was the only song played from the album, so fans began to speculate why Swift chose only one song. Conspiracies about hidden easter eggs formed on social media.
            Fans believe that "Speak Now" was only performed for a short amount of time because Swift will soon release her re-recording of this album. Back in 2010, Swift wrote and produced the entire album on her own, so this era is associated with her independence and femininity as an artist. 
            Although Swifties were disappointed with the single song, she made up for it with the gold and white sequin Nicole + Felicia Couture ball gown. The dress was different from what most fans would have expected, since this era is associated with the color purple, but no one was complaining after seeing how alluring the dress was.

      </div>
      <div class="about-text">
        <h2>Red</h2>
        <p>Swift recreated the iconic "22" music video look by changing her white tee from “Not a lot going on at the moment” to “A lot going on at the moment.” This change demonstrates how far she has come since releasing the original version in 2012.

            Another hypothetical easter egg that fans are considering is that each letter highlighted in red on her tees spell out “Speak Now (Taylor’s Version).” The deep red color used in this era is a representation of the heartbreak that came from it. Other ways to recognize this era is with scarves, high waisted shorts, vintage dresses and lots of stripes.
            
            After performing classics from this album like "We Are Never Getting Back Together" and "I Knew You Were Trouble," Swift took off her T-shirt, revealing a red and black ombre bodysuit underneath. She eventually threw a red sequin trench coat over the bodysuit and took out a matching red guitar for the 10-minute performance of "All Too Well (Taylor’s Version)."

      <div class="about-text">
        <h2>Folklore</h2>
        <p>As "invisible string" filled the air, Swifties were greeted with the sight of Taylor Swift adorned in a stunning, flowing gown crafted by Alberta Ferretti. The ethereal, ruffled dress in muted lavender perfectly encapsulated the whimsical essence of the "folklore" era, reminiscent of fairy-tale enchantment.
<br>
            Echoing the transition from summer to fall, the "folklore" aesthetic was characterized by gingham prints, lightweight cardigans, and the iconic wispy bangs. As Swift gracefully moved across the stage during the performance of "august," the billowing fabric of the dress mirrored the emotions she poured into this era.
            <br>
            
            On the second night, Swift made a subtle change, opting for a cream version of the dress, once again custom-made by Ferretti. This variation added a soft, timeless elegance to her stage presence, further enhancing the enchanting atmosphere of the "folklore" era.

        <h2>1989</h2>
        <p>
            In the era of "1989," Taylor Swift found herself amidst a flurry of paparazzi, glamorous gatherings, and nostalgic snapshots. Embracing the essence of the time, Swift returned to her trademark sequins and fringe, adorned in yet another custom creation by Cavalli. This two-piece ensemble, adorned with dark pink fringe in various shapes, swayed effortlessly to the rhythm of dance-pop anthems like "Shake It Off" and "Bad Blood."
            <br>

            On the following night, Swift mesmerized in an identical ensemble, this time in a vibrant lime green hue, complete with perfectly coordinated shoes. This period marked Swift's official transition into the realm of pop stardom, characterized by her distinct short hair, vibrant colors, and an assortment of playful skirts. While polka dots remained a notable element of her aesthetic, Swift opted for a more refined interpretation for "The Eras Tour," showcasing a matured version of her iconic style.

        <h2>Midnights</h2>
        <p>The most recent era for Taylor Swift was her "Midnights" era, which was released shortly before her tour. Swift's whimsical pop side returned with this album. Diamonds, navy blues, dark purples and stars are just a few of the ways to recognize this era. The original sequins and glitter aesthetics were also brought back with this album, which made Swifties happy. She started this era off with "Lavender Haze", wearing a sequined, lavender mini dress with a fluffy feathered coat on top, custom made by Oscar De La Renta. Swift left the coat behind when she went to perform "Anti-Hero." The final look of the night was a black sequined bodysuit with a fringe bottom. Fans thought that was it – until a rainbow fringe jacket was draped over her while she performed the final song of the night, "Karma."
